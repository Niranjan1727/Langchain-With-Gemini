**LangChain + Gemini API Integration**
This repository demonstrates the integration of LangChain with the Gemini API to create a powerful and versatile text generation and image description system. The project leverages Gemini's advanced language models to perform a variety of tasks, including text generation, image description, and document interaction using Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG).

**Features**
1. **Text Generation**
Utilizes the Gemini API to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This feature can be adapted for multiple applications, including content creation, automated responses, and more.

2. **Image Description**
The project includes functionality for describing images using Gemini's large language model (LLM). This allows for detailed and accurate descriptions, making it useful for accessibility features, content generation, and more.

3. **Chat with Documents using RAG**
This feature allows users to interact with documents through a chat interface. By combining document embeddings with the power of Gemini's LLM, users can retrieve information from documents in a conversational manner.

4. **RAG Pipeline: Embedding + Gemini (LLM)**
The RAG pipeline implemented in this project enhances the ability to retrieve and generate contextually accurate information from a large corpus of documents. This is achieved by creating document embeddings and utilizing Gemini's LLM for generating human-like responses.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.7+
LangChain
Gemini API Access
**Installation**
**Clone the repository:**
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
**Install the required dependencies:**
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
**Set up your Gemini API key:**
python

import gemini
gemini.api_key = 'your-gemini-api-key'
**Usage**
**Text Generation**: Check the text_generation.py file for examples of generating text using the Gemini API.
**Image Description**: Use the image_description.py script to generate descriptions for your images.
**Chat with Documents (RAG)**: The rag_chat.py file demonstrates how to interact with documents using a chat interface powered by the RAG pipeline.
Example

from langchain import LangChain
import gemini

# Initialize LangChain with Gemini API
chain = LangChain(api_key='your-gemini-api-key')

# Text Generation Example
text = chain.generate_text("Describe the impact of AI on healthcare.")
print(text)

# Image Description Example
description = chain.describe_image('path/to/your/image.jpg')
print(description)

# Chat with Documents Example
response = chain.chat_with_document("Tell me about the company's financial status in the last quarter.")
print(response)
